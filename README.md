## Overview

New York City has a booming nightlife scene. With a wide offering of sports bars, dive bars, cocktail dens, and bottle-service-only dance clubs,  thereâ€™s a reason why New York is called the "city that never sleeps". However, late-night parties affect residential areas and in some cases, the police get involved with noise complaints. 

In the summer of 2017, Mayor de Blasio signed a bill to create an ["Office of Nightlife"](https://nypost.com/2017/09/19/de-blasios-newest-city-agency-office-of-nightlife/) to promote a vibrant nightlife scene while keeping residential areas safe. 

This app visualizes nightlife-related noise complaint acitvity across New York City's boroughs to help better understand when and where the nightclubs are affecting city residents.
