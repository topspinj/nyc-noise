## Overview

New York City has a booming nightlife scene. With a wide offering of sports bars, dive bars, cocktail dens, and bottle-service-only dance clubs,  thereâ€™s a reason why New York is called the "city that never sleeps". However, late-night parties affect residential areas and in some cases, the police get involved with noise complaints. 

This R Shiny app visualizes nightlife-related noise complaint acitvity across New York City's boroughs to help better understand when and where the nightclubs are affecting city residents. 


## Data source

This app uses 311* service request data from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/), filtered for type "noise complaints" with descriptor "loud music/party".
